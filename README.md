## Jimmy Chion is a designer and engineer :wave: 

If you would like to chat about anything, feel free to reach out: jimmychion@gmail.com.

Current ideas I want to work on but haven't started yet:
* A website of things web developers do **not** do, but could. Domain TBD, but something along the lines of websitesdontdothis.com
