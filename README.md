## Jimmy Chion is a designer and engineer

:wave:  I'm currently at The New York Times [R&D](https://rd.nytimes.com). If you would like to chat about anything, feel free to reach out: jimmychion@gmail.com.

Current ideas I want to work on but haven't started yet:
* A React hooks cookbook, with React hook recipes. I already bought the domain hookbook.dev. It's not a dating site.
* A website of things web developers do **not** do, but could. Domain TBD, but something along the lines of websitesdontdothis.com
